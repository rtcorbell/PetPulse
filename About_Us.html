        <p>In the past, I owned six budgies years ago. They were very adorable, enjoyed chirping, flying around the room, often perching on my shoulder or head and fight a lot as well.
            Despite my fondness for birds, I’ve always desired to have a dog or cat but haven’t had the chance yet and eagerly await the day I can welcome one into my home.
            Owning a pet, whether it’s a bird, dog, or cat, is a gratifying experience. Pets offer companionship, affection, amusement, and can alleviate stress and anxiety. </p>
