    <h2>Pet Story</h2>
    <p>Although I've always had a deep love for dogs, my busy schedule currently doesn't allow me the time and attention they deserve. However, I've been making plans and preparations, and in the near future, I'm excited to welcome a sweet Doodle Poodle into my life, ready to embark on a journey of companionship and wagging tails!</p>
